The giving tree

In a state of solitude, the boy trudged along the muddy 
paths of the forest. He came across an apple tree and 
decided to rest under its calm shade before continuing 
his journey to the city. To his astonishment, the tree 
began talking to him,"Hey there, come sit under my shade. 
It will soothe you." The boy was already too tired. He sat 
down. ,,
